Jest cannot parse, e.g. it's not plain JavaScript.\n\n    By default, if Jest sees a Babel config, it will use that to transform your files, ignoring \"node_modules\".\n\n    Here's what you can do:\n     • If you are trying to use ECMAScript Modules, see \u001b[4mhttps://jestjs.io/docs/en/ecmascript-modules\u001b[24m for how to enable it.\n     • To have some of your \"node_modules\" files transformed, you can specify a custom \u001b[1m\"transformIgnorePatterns\"\u001b[22m in your config.\n     • If you need a custom transformation specify a \u001b[1m\"transform\"\u001b[22m option in your config.\n     • If you simply want to mock your non-JS modules (e.g. binary assets) you can stub them out with the \u001b[1m\"moduleNameMapper\"\u001b[22m config option.\n\n    You'll find more details and examples of these config options in the docs:\n    \u001b[36mhttps://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration.html\u001b[39m\n\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[31mDetails:\u001b[39m\u001b[22m\n\n
